<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work on FlowMind Analytics primarily focused on bringing core functionalities to a production-ready state, addressing critical UI/UX bugs, and implementing new features incrementally based on user feedback. Initial efforts were centered on resolving persistent frontend issues that blocked TradeStation authentication and ensuring live market data integration. Subsequent development involved significant refactoring of the Investment Scoring and Technical Analysis modules to use live TradeStation data. The engineer also dramatically enhanced the Investment Analysis page and replaced a basic Sector Leaders section with a highly interactive, professional Market Heatmap mimicking the style of Unusual Whales. Most recently, a comprehensive Portfolios section was initiated, with detailed step-by-step implementation of portfolio creation flows and individual portfolio views, ensuring a smooth user experience.

<product_requirements>
FlowMind Analytics is envisioned as a comprehensive stock analysis and trading platform featuring a professional, responsive UI/UX with real-time data, tables, and P&L color-coding. Core requirements include accurate portfolio data, robust TradeStation OAuth 2.0 authentication, advanced position management, and a dedicated account balance page. The platform integrates AI agents for Investment Scoring (utilizing Unusual Whales data) and Technical Analysis (using Smart Money Concepts), alongside a Top Picks section. An Options Module is also planned to replicate OptionStrat.com's UI/UX, requiring TradeStation and Unusual Whales integration for options data. Recent focus has been on ensuring live prices are displayed correctly across all modules, improving the Investment Scoring module's display and backend capabilities, and establishing a robust Portfolios section. The system aims to use live data for all analyses, with streaming capabilities as a future enhancement.

<code_architecture>


-   : The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate new stock scanner endpoints, TradeStation authentication, and handle market data fetching logic. Routes for advanced scoring were refined, especially  and . Added  endpoint.
-   : Contains core logic for stock scanning/scoring and risk assessment.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated  and heavily modified to implement multi-factor scoring, Beta analysis, and enhanced risk assessment logic (, ).
-   : Implements multi-factor investment scoring.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to explicitly fetch and include live stock price data via  for Top Investment Picks and individual comprehensive score calculations, addressing a  stock data issue.
-   : The central React component for routing, global state, and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Updated routing to include  using . Added a new top-level Portfolios section to the sidebar, with sub-sections for All Portfolios, Portfolio 1,2,3, HTech 15T, and Create Portfolio. Integrated new components for portfolio management and routing for their respective pages (, , , , ).
-   : Displays scanner results, Top Investment Picks, Sector Leaders, and Portfolio Risk Analysis.
    -   **Changes**: Critically modified to fetch live prices from the correct backend endpoint (), removing all mock data fallbacks. The Stock Analysis tab was completely removed to avoid duplication with AI Agent. The Sector Leaders tab was replaced with a dynamic, professional market heatmap inspired by Unusual Whales, including variable tile sizes based on market cap and advanced color coding. The Risk Analysis tab was renamed Portfolio Risk Analysis and repurposed with static/fallback data for portfolio construction strategies, explaining low/moderate/high-risk stock categories in a portfolio context, and fixing a bug where it was empty. Missing Lucide icon imports (, , ) were added.
-   : (Original) Displayed stock analysis.
    -   **Changes**: Replaced by .
-    (NEW): A new component created to provide a comprehensive, professional stock analysis view.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented a detailed UI with a professional header, summary cards (Investment Score, Technical Score, Recommendation, Risk Level), three columns for score breakdown, a , key strengths, key risks, and data source indicators. The Back to Scanner button text was changed to Scoring. Fixed an overlapping chart issue by adjusting container height and chart CSS to ensure it fits within its bounds.
-   : Component for displaying interactive trading charts.
    -   **Changes**: Adjusted internal height and overflow properties to prevent it from breaking parent layouts.
-    (NEW): Component for displaying an overview of all created portfolios.
    -   **Changes**: Initial simple placeholder component.
-    (NEW): Component for the portfolio creation wizard.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented UI for naming a portfolio and selecting creation methods: Link Broker, Upload CSV, and Manual Entry.
-    (NEW): Component for manual entry of symbols in portfolio creation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on building out the Portfolios section of the application. The user had just provided a screenshot of the interior of an individual portfolio (e.g., Portfolio HTech 15T) and requested its implementation.

The engineer's last action was to successfully implement the  component, which displays a detailed view of a selected portfolio. This included:
- A header showing the portfolio name (e.g., Portfolio HTech 15T), total value, and daily performance.
- A tab navigation bar with Summary, Health Score, Ratings, Holdings, Dividends, and a + Add / Edit Views button with a red arrow.
- A comprehensive table of holdings, displaying details like symbol, current price, daily change (absolute and percentage), weight percentage, volume, average volume, day range, 52-week range, and multiple ratings (Quant SA, SA Analyst, Wall Street) with corresponding color coding.

The implementation successfully replicated the provided screenshot, including precise layout, data presentation, and interactive elements. The  component was created, and its routing () was integrated into  to allow dynamic access to individual portfolios. The frontend was restarted and confirmed to be fully functional with the newly added portfolio view.
