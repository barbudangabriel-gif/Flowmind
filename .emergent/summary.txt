The AI engineer successfully transitioned FlowMind Analytics from an MVP to a sophisticated financial analysis platform. The trajectory demonstrates an iterative, highly responsive approach to user feedback, directly addressing reported bugs and enhancing features. Key accomplishments included debugging and activating live Dark Pool and Options Flow data integration with Unusual Whales, which involved multiple rounds of fixing API endpoint issues, data parsing, and UI display. A significant challenge was the conflicting information about Unusual Whales' official API for options flow, which the AI navigated by initially implementing highly realistic mock data, then definitively identifying and integrating the correct live API endpoint after user clarification. Subsequent enhancements focused on real-time data flow (auto-refresh down to 1 second), and enriching the Options Flow table with detailed Action Type (BUY TO OPEN/SELL TO CLOSE) and trade-specific information, mirroring professional platforms like OptionStrat. The work concluded with the user providing TradeStation API keys, signaling the next phase of integration.

<product_requirements>
The FlowMind Analytics application was conceived as a professional stock analysis platform. Initial requirements included S&P 500/NASDAQ ticker data display, Investment Scoring (fundamental, technical, sentiment), and integration of Smart Money, Price Action, and Sentiment Analysis. A major UI/UX overhaul was mandated for a modern sidebar, enhanced dashboard, responsiveness, and performance. Recent high-priority requests focused on integrating the Unusual Whales API for options flow, dark pool, congressional trades, and AI-generated strategies. The user explicitly requested real-time Options Flow data, which initially showed mock data or zero premiums, and then requested auto-refresh functionality, specific buy/sell indicators, and then detailed action type (e.g., BUY TO OPEN). The ultimate goal is to evolve into an Automated Options Trading section with TradeStation compatibility for portfolio and trade execution.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB.
-   **Financial Data Integration**: Unusual Whales API.
-   **Frontend**: React (hooks, state management,  for auto-refresh), Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, .
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisor.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup:


-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application routing and core API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed multiple  errors in the  endpoint by ensuring type conversions (e.g., , ) and handling  values. The Options Flow endpoint was updated to correctly call and process data from  based on the newly confirmed correct endpoint.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes all Unusual Whales API interactions and data processing.
    -   **Changes**: Initially,  was updated for correct parsing. Significant changes involved  to generate highly realistic mock data when real API data was unavailable, including  types (BUY/SELL). Crucially, the logic for the Options Flow API was revised multiple times. First, to bypass  for mock data. Then, after user confirmation of a valid subscription, the API call was updated to the *correct* endpoint () and  was adapted to parse the real API response, mapping fields like , , , and  to the expected data model.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables, including API keys.
    -   **Changes**:  was confirmed to be correctly set.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, structuring UI and state for the dashboard and Options Flow.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   The 📊 Demo Data badge was removed.
        -   A 🔴 Live Data badge was added, later refined to ⚡ Real-Time Options Flow and 🔴 LIVE • 1s updates, to indicate the actual data source and refresh rate.
        -   The Options Flow table columns were updated: initially showing N/A for premium if unavailable, then displaying actual premium once real data was flowing.
        -   A new Action column was added for BUY/SELL status with green/red colors.
        -   This Action column was then refined to Action Type displaying full statuses (e.g., BUY TO OPEN, SELL TO CLOSE) with distinct colors for each of the four types (green for BUY TO OPEN, orange for SELL TO CLOSE).
        -   The redundant Opening column was removed.
        -   Auto-refresh functionality was implemented using  and , initially at 30 seconds, then reduced to 5 seconds, and finally to **1 second** to match OptionStrat's speed. This included a visual countdown timer.
        -   The table structure was modified to include , , , and  columns, and symbols were made clickable (visual link).
-   : No new changes mentioned in trajectory beyond initial structure.
-   : No new changes mentioned in trajectory beyond initial structure.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full integration of real-time sentiment analysis, awaiting API keys (specifically Reddit API credentials).
-   Integration of TradeStation API for core portfolio data and trade execution, which is the current focus, awaiting full implementation based on provided credentials.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in making the Options Flow data display as real-time and detailed as possible, akin to professional platforms like OptionStrat.

Specifically, the following was completed:
1.  **Options Flow Speed**: The auto-refresh rate for the Options Flow table in  was adjusted from 30 seconds down to **1 second**. This involved modifying  and state management for .
2.  **Detailed Options Flow Table**: The  frontend table displaying Options Flow data was significantly enhanced to include:
    *   A  column showing precise timestamps (e.g., 6:34:57 PM).
    *   A  column providing detailed action types (e.g., SELL 349 Put To Close, BUY 8464 Call To Open), replacing the previous Action Type and Opening columns.
    *   An  column (e.g., Feb 20, Oct 31).
    *   A  column for trade types like SWEEP and SPLIT.
    *   Symbols were made visually linkable (blue text).
3.  **Real-Time Status Indicators**: The header was updated to clearly indicate ⚡ Real-Time Options Flow, 🔴 LIVE • 1s updates, and Actualizare în 1s (countdown).

The application now provides a highly granular, real-time Options Flow experience with detailed trade information.

The very last exchange shows the user providing TradeStation API keys and clarifying their purpose (portfolio, automated/manual trading). The AI engineer has acknowledged this and is preparing to integrate the TradeStation API.
