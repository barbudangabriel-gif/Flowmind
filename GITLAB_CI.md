# 🦊 FlowMind Analytics - GitLab CI Quality Gates

## 📋 GitLab CI Implementation

Complete quality gates implementation for GitLab CI/CD with comprehensive testing and security scanning.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Pipeline Configuration

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is already configured with:

- **3 stages**: `fe`, `be`, `gate`
- **Auto-detection**: Yarn vs NPM support
- **Caching**: NPM and Pip dependencies
- **Artifacts**: Build outputs and test reports
- **Security**: npm audit + pip-audit + bandit

### 2. GitLab Project Settings

#### Required Settings:

```bash
# Navigate to your GitLab project
Settings → CI/CD → Runners
# ✅ Ensure Shared Runners are enabled

Settings → General → Merge request approvals  
# ✅ Check "Pipelines must succeed"
# This blocks MRs with failed quality gates

Settings → Repository → Protected branches
# ✅ Protect main/master branch
# ✅ Require merge requests
```

#### Optional but Recommended:
```bash
Settings → General → Merge request approvals
# ✅ "Reset approvals when new commits are added"
# ✅ "Enable 'Delete source branch' option by default"

Settings → CI/CD → General pipelines
# ✅ "Auto-cancel redundant pipelines"
```

### 3. Local Development Setup

#### Frontend (Husky + lint-staged):
```bash
cd frontend

# If using NPM
npm ci
npx husky install

# If using Yarn  
corepack enable
yarn install --immutable
yarn husky install
```

#### Backend (pre-commit):
```bash
cd backend
pip install pre-commit ruff mypy bandit
pre-commit install
```

## 📊 Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Frontend (`fe`)
```yaml
✅ Auto-detects Yarn vs NPM
✅ Installs dependencies with caching
✅ Runs ESLint with zero tolerance
✅ Builds application (if build script exists)
✅ Security audit (high-level vulnerabilities)
✅ Saves build artifacts for 1 week
```

### Stage 2: Backend (`be`) 
```yaml
✅ Python 3.11 environment
✅ Installs all quality tools
✅ Ruff linting with GitHub output format
✅ Ruff format checking
✅ MyPy type checking
✅ Bandit security scanning (low-level+)
✅ pip-audit dependency security (strict)
✅ pytest testing (optional, continues on failure)
✅ Caches pip dependencies and tool caches
```

### Stage 3: Gate (`gate`)
```yaml
✅ Requires both frontend AND backend to pass
✅ Lightweight Alpine image for fast execution
✅ Final checkpoint before allowing merge
```

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

### Adjusting Strictness

#### Frontend Audit Levels:
```yaml
# Current (strict)
yarn audit --level high
npm audit --audit-level=high

# Less strict (only critical)
yarn audit --level critical  
npm audit --audit-level=critical

# Warning only (doesn't fail pipeline)
yarn audit --level high || true
npm audit --audit-level=high || true
```

#### Backend Security Levels:
```yaml
# Current (strict - fails on any vulnerability)
pip-audit -r requirements.txt --strict

# Less strict (only reports, doesn't fail)
pip-audit -r requirements.txt

# Bandit levels
bandit -ll -r .  # Low-level and above (current)
bandit -l -r .   # Medium-level and above  
bandit -h -r .   # High-level only
```

### Yarn vs NPM Detection

The pipeline automatically detects package manager:

```yaml
# Auto-detection logic
if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then
  # Use Yarn
  corepack enable
  yarn install --immutable
  yarn run lint
else
  # Use NPM  
  npm ci
  npm run lint
fi
```

### Caching Strategy

```yaml
# Frontend caching
cache:
  key: "${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}-fe"
  paths:
    - .cache/npm/    # NPM cache
    - node_modules/  # Node modules

# Backend caching
cache:
  key: "${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}-be"  
  paths:
    - .cache/pip/           # Pip cache
    - backend/.ruff_cache/  # Ruff cache
    - backend/.mypy_cache/  # MyPy cache
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Manual Pipeline Trigger
```bash
# Push to trigger pipeline
git push origin feature-branch

# Create MR to trigger MR pipeline
# GitLab will automatically run quality gates
```

### Local Testing (matches CI exactly)
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run lint        # Same as CI
npm run build       # Same as CI
npm audit --audit-level=high  # Same as CI

# Backend
cd backend
ruff check .        # Same as CI
ruff format --check # Same as CI  
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports --pretty  # Same as CI
bandit -ll -r . -x tests  # Same as CI
pip-audit -r requirements.txt --strict  # Same as CI
```

## 📊 Pipeline Artifacts

### Frontend Artifacts:
- `frontend/build/` - Built application (1 week retention)
- Lint reports and build logs

### Backend Artifacts:  
- `junit*.xml` - Test reports (GitLab integration)
- `.ruff_cache/` - Ruff caching data
- `.mypy_cache/` - MyPy caching data
- Security scan reports

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Runner Out of Memory
```yaml
variables:
  NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=4096  # Increase from 2048
```

#### 2. Slow Dependency Installation
```yaml
# Enable more aggressive caching
cache:
  key: "${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}"
  paths:
    - node_modules/
    - .cache/
  policy: pull-push
```

#### 3. False Positives in Security Scans
```yaml
# Bandit: exclude specific issues
bandit -ll -r . -x tests -s B101,B601

# pip-audit: ignore specific vulnerabilities  
pip-audit --ignore-vuln GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

#### 4. Different Behavior Local vs CI
```bash
# Use exact same environment locally
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace node:20 bash
# Then run same commands as CI
```

## 🎯 Quality Gate Rules

### MR Blocking Conditions:
- ❌ ESLint errors or warnings
- ❌ Build failures  
- ❌ High/critical npm security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Ruff linting errors
- ❌ Ruff formatting issues
- ❌ MyPy type checking errors
- ❌ Bandit security issues (low-level+)
- ❌ pip-audit security vulnerabilities

### MR Allows:
- ✅ pytest failures (continues with warning)
- ✅ Minor formatting differences (ruff auto-fixes)
- ✅ MyPy warnings on missing imports

## 🎉 Benefits

### Development Experience:
- **Fast feedback**: Quality issues caught immediately
- **Consistent environment**: CI matches local development
- **Automated fixes**: Many issues auto-resolved by pre-commit hooks
- **Security focus**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning

### Team Benefits:
- **Code consistency**: Enforced formatting and linting
- **Security assurance**: Multi-layer security scanning  
- **Quality confidence**: No low-quality code reaches main
- **Review efficiency**: MRs pre-validated for quality

## 📋 Migration from GitHub Actions

If switching from GitHub Actions to GitLab CI:

1. ✅ Keep all local hooks (husky, pre-commit) - they work identically
2. ✅ Replace `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with `.gitlab-ci.yml`  
3. ✅ Configure GitLab project settings as documented above
4. ✅ Same quality standards, same local development experience

Both platforms now supported with identical quality enforcement! 🚀
