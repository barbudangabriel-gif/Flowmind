Subject: Add Redirect URI to TradeStation SIMULATOR App (Client ID: XEs0URG1rMrGDUFRKVhlDaclvQKq8Qpj)

Hello TradeStation Developer Support,

I need to add a new Redirect URI to my existing SIMULATOR application for development testing.

**Application Details:**
- Client ID: XEs0URG1rMrGDUFRKVhlDaclvQKq8Qpj
- Client Secret: NsAIybzKV6GbYGqQZwF0cHypdXfwiDYL5-EY4nRXEbIy748Zp-FdeuDXJIu6Jhwk
- Environment: SIMULATOR

**Please add this Redirect URI:**
https://sturdy-system-wvrqjjp49wg29qxx-8000.app.github.dev/api/oauth/tradestation/callback

**Current Scopes (if not already enabled, please add):**
- openid
- offline_access
- MarketData
- ReadAccount
- Trade

**Purpose:**
Development environment for FlowMind Analytics - an options trading platform integrating with TradeStation API for market data and portfolio management. This URL is our GitHub Codespaces development endpoint.

Please confirm when the redirect URI has been added.

Thank you,
Gabriel Barbuda
FlowMind Analytics
