# Pull Request: Quality Gates Implementation

## What

Complete implementation of quality gates and CI/CD pipeline for FlowMind Analytics:

- **Frontend**: Husky + lint-staged (eslint --fix, prettier on misc files)
- **Backend**: pre-commit hooks (ruff --fix, mypy, bandit)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline (FE lint/build/audit; BE ruff/mypy/bandit/pip-audit/pytest)

## Why

Block low-quality code & high/critical vulnerabilities before merge; consistent QA across Frontend/Backend.

### Problem Solved:
- No automated code quality enforcement
- Inconsistent code formatting
- Security vulnerabilities could reach production
- No CI/CD quality gates

### Solution:
- Pre-commit hooks auto-fix code quality issues
- CI pipeline blocks PRs with quality/security issues
- Consistent code formatting and linting
- Type safety with MyPy checking
- Security scanning with Bandit + npm/pip audit

## 🛠️ How to use locally

### Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npx husky install # Install hooks
# Commits will now auto-lint and format staged files
```

### Backend:
```bash
cd backend
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# Commits will now run ruff, mypy, bandit checks
```

### Testing Quality Gates:
```bash
# Frontend
npm run lint # Check linting
npm run format # Format code
npm run build # Test build

# Backend 
pre-commit run --all-files # Run all hooks
ruff check . # Check linting
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports # Type checking
```

## 📁 Files Changed

### Frontend:
- `frontend/package.json` - Added lint scripts, lint-staged config, husky prepare
- `frontend/.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook running lint-staged

### Backend:
- `backend/.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- `backend/mypy.ini` - MyPy type checking configuration

### CI/CD:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - GitHub Actions pipeline with quality gates

## Merge Safety

- **No runtime logic changed** - Only QA/CI configuration files
- **Rollback strategy** - Simple revert PR if issues arise
- **Non-breaking** - Existing functionality remains unchanged
- **Additive** - Only adds quality enforcement, doesn't modify app logic

## 🧪 Testing

- [x] Frontend lint/build/audit pipeline tested
- [x] Backend ruff/mypy/bandit checks tested 
- [x] Pre-commit hooks working locally
- [x] CI pipeline configuration validated
- [x] All quality gates functional

## Acceptance Criteria

All P0 objectives met:

- **Frontend**: Husky + lint-staged – lint+format pe fișierele staged înainte de commit
- **Backend**: pre-commit – ruff format+lint, mypy, bandit la commit 
- **CI**: GitHub Actions – blochează PR-urile dacă pică lint/test/SCA

## Impact

After merge:
- **Zero low-quality commits** reach main branch
- **Consistent code style** across entire codebase
- **Security vulnerabilities** caught before production
- **Type safety** enforced in Python code
- **Automated quality** without manual intervention
